'<h2>Henrich-Johnson Woods</h2>

<p>This land is owned and maintained by the Land Preservation Society of Norton.

<p>From their website:</p>

<p><i>The Henrich and Johnson Woods are two adjacent donated woodlands where trails can take visitors through numerous distinct ecological features.
Vernal pools are numerous but dwarfed by a large pond populated by frogs and salamanders.
Continuing along the trail, you will find small patches of American beech trees within a pine forest with a notable woodpecker presence as made evident by the holes they left behind.
Eventually, you will find a bend in the Rumford River peeking through the trees, flanked by shrubs that songbirds pick berries from.</i></p>
